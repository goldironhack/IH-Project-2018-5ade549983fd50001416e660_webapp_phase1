Description First Delivery:
For the present delivery, I focused my work on obtaining data from some of the DATASETS provided, more specifically 3 of the mandatory DataSets related to "Area", "Security", "Constructions", this, in order to understand and analyze the data to which they will be given a specific management according to the requirements.
For each DATASET, a table was created in which the most important data is displayed in an orderly manner, with a Scroll implemented to facilitate this visualization.
On the page there are two buttons, the first "GetData", has the function of obtaining the data of each DATASET and entering them in the respective dispositions, and the second, "UpdateTables", has the function of entering the specific data in the tables.
CSS and JS were used for this part of the work.
The data was obtained from DATASETS: Neighborhood Names GIS, Crime in NY, Dataset contains information about the housing of the city of New York through the construction of data.
The graphic implementation has not been carried out since my intention is to work first in the analysis of the data so that in this way a better space management can be proposed given the requirements and situations that arise

Test Case:
The project has been tested in the Google Chrome browser without presenting any problems.
